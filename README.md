Project Proposal Document
1. Project Idea: Music Player App with YouTube Integration
Project Overview:
The app will allow users to search for YouTube videos, stream only the audio from these videos, and create a personalized playlist for listening.
Why I Chose This Idea:
YouTube is one of the largest sources of audio and video content. Integrating its content into an app allows users to access music without needing to leave the app.
The project helps me gain experience with APIs, front-end technologies, and audio streaming.
It combines two of my passions: software development and music (DJing).
Key Features:
Search YouTube videos by song name or artist.
Play YouTube videos in audio-only mode.
Add songs to a custom playlist.
Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.

2. API to Use: YouTube Data API v3 & YouTube IFrame Player API
YouTube Data API v3
The YouTube Data API will be used for:
Searching for videos based on user input (song title, artist name).
Fetching video details such as title, thumbnail, and video ID.
Key Features of the API:
Video Search: Query YouTube's database using keywords and filters.
Metadata Retrieval: Access video details like title, description, and thumbnail images.
Quotas: Allows up to 10,000 API requests per day for free.
YouTube IFrame Player API
The IFrame Player API will handle:
Embedding and playing the YouTube video/audio.
Hiding the video player to simulate audio-only playback.
Managing playback controls (play, pause, stop, etc.).
